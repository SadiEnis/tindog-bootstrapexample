### Sample mobile application ad page developed using only HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

---

I used bootstrap snippets for the web page. I wanted to ensure that it was compatible with different widths and thus I wanted to obtain an image compatible with both mobile devices and computers.
Below is the view for different sizes:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
<details>
  <summary>Desktop</summary>
  <img src="images/ss1.png" alt="Fotoğraf 1" width="500">
</details>
<details>
<summary>Laptop</summary>
  <img src="images/ss2.png" alt="Fotoğraf 2" width="500">
</details>
<details>
<summary>Mobile</summary>
  <img src="images/ss3.png" alt="Fotoğraf 3" width="500">
<details>

</div>

I used Bootstrap Examples for the web page. I revised the colors and structure. Below is an example:
<div style="justify-content: center; align-content: center;">
  <img src="images/ss4.png" alt="Fotoğraf 4" width="500">
</div>
